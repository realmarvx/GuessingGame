# README: My First Python Game

## About the Project
Welcome to my first Python project! This is my first attempt at creating a game using Python, and I am thrilled to share it with you. While I am not new to programming, this project marks my initial exploration into the Python language. It represents the beginning of what I hope will be an exciting journey of learning and growth in Python.

## Game Overview: Number Guessing Game
The game is a simple number guessing game. Players are tasked with guessing a randomly generated number within a specified range and limited number of attempts. The game provides feedback on whether the guessed number is too high or too low, helping players refine their guesses. 

### Features:
- Set your own lower and upper bounds for the random number.
- Choose the maximum number of attempts allowed.
- Receive feedback on each guess to guide you.
- Win by guessing the correct number within the given tries or lose and see the correct number revealed.

## How to Play
1. Run the game in a Python environment.
2. Input the lower bound, upper bound, and the maximum number of attempts.
3. Start guessing the number based on the feedback provided.
4. If you guess the number correctly within the allowed attempts, you win! Otherwise, the correct number will be revealed.

## Future Updates
As I continue to learn and improve my skills in Python, I plan to:
- Optimize the code for better performance.
- Add new features such as difficulty levels and a scoring system.
- Enhance the user interface for a more interactive experience.

This game will evolve as I learn more about programming concepts, Python libraries, and game design.

## Acknowledgments
Thank you for taking the time to check out my project. Your support and feedback are invaluable as I continue to learn and grow.

## Final Note
This is just the beginning! There will be more projects to come as I explore the endless possibilities with Python. Stay tuned for updates and new creations!
